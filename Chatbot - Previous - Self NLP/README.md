# MedInsta
Built a speech recognition AI chatbot, that could accurately figure out the health concern &amp; condition of the user, based on communication and further question responses in conversation. After figuring the illness, it provided instant remedies, cures, food habits and medications to provide instant medical help.

Built using Python, dictionary database, and Django & frontend.
However the Django files have been misplaced. The simple python backend is only left behind.
